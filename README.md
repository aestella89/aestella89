- I have recently rebuilt the motor in my 1991 Nissan 300zx as well as replaced the motor in my 1998 Honda Accord by myself and am very proud of these facts, I am learning coding for Python (new user I have some experience with the JAVA language)
- , I am learning Japanese currently (douzo yoroshiku), I am very interested in all things computer tech related although I am a beginner and have recently received an Arkletra and am learning how to build circuits and the like, I love to read
- philosophy fiction and non-fiction, I am a HUGE movie buff and have seen a ton of movies, I am more of a Marvel fan than DC although I do love Batman, I enjoy learning in general and am always out to try new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, as well as my full course load for Aerospace Engineering (3rd Year), Japanese, and circuitry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is within my ability. Though right now that is not much without some explaining from my corraborator. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best estella.andrew@yahoo.com with subject: Github
- 😄 Pronouns: me/my he/him (I'm 34 and a dude... yall can keep the pronouns)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am super outgoing. I have recently got into skydiving, and except the fear of failure resulting in death and my son/family living on without me I LOVE to skydive!!! Going fast is my favorite thing to do in any way shape or form.
